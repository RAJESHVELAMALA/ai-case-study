This project/idea originated from *Jon Stein*'s personal frustration with the complexities and high fees associated with traditional investment options. Stein, who was working in finance at the time, recognized the need for a simpler, more accessible way for individuals to invest their money.

The project began to take shape around *2008* when Jon Stein decided to pursue the idea of creating a technology-driven investment platform that would prioritize the needs of individual investors. He teamed up with Eli Broverman, a fellow Harvard Business School graduate, and they began working on building the foundation for what would become Betterment.

The initial stages involved extensive research and planning to understand the pain points of traditional investment services and to conceptualize a solution that would address these issues. Jon Stein and Eli Broverman were driven by the vision of democratizing access to investment management and providing transparent, low-cost solutions for everyday investors.

In *2010*, Betterment officially launched its robo-advisor platform to the public, offering automated investment management services with personalized portfolios tailored to individual goals and risk preferences. The platform utilized algorithms and technology to automate portfolio construction, rebalancing, and tax optimization, making investing more accessible and convenient for users.

Betterment has been funded through several rounds of venture capital financing, as well as revenue generated from its services. Here's an overview of the funding history of Betterment:

One unique service that Betterment provides is its tax-coordinated portfolio strategy. This offering addresses a significant pain point for investors by optimizing the allocation of assets across different types of accounts to minimize taxes and maximize after-tax returns.

Here's how Betterment's tax-coordinated portfolio strategy works and why it's unique:

- Tax Optimization: Betterment's algorithms analyze a client's entire investment portfolio, including taxable accounts, IRAs, and other retirement accounts. The platform then strategically allocates assets across these accounts to take advantage of tax efficiencies.
- Asset Location: Betterment aims to place tax-inefficient assets, such as bonds or REITs, in tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs, where their returns are shielded from taxes. Meanwhile, tax-efficient assets, such as stocks, may be held in taxable accounts to take advantage of favorable capital gains tax rates.
- Automated Management: Betterment automates the management of the tax-coordinated portfolio, regularly rebalancing and adjusting asset allocations as needed to maintain tax efficiency over time. This relieves investors of the burden of monitoring their portfolios and making manual adjustments to optimize tax outcomes.
- Maximizing After-Tax Returns: By optimizing the allocation of assets across taxable and tax-advantaged accounts, Betterment's tax-coordinated portfolio strategy aims to minimize the investor's overall tax liability while maximizing after-tax returns. This can result in significant long-term savings for investors, particularly those in higher tax brackets.
- Holistic Approach: What sets Betterment's tax-coordinated portfolio strategy apart is its holistic approach to tax optimization across an investor's entire portfolio. Rather than focusing solely on individual investments or accounts, Betterment considers the tax implications of the portfolio as a whole, resulting in a more comprehensive and effective tax management strategy.

**Overall, Betterment's tax-coordinated portfolio strategy addresses a key pain point for investors by providing a sophisticated yet user-friendly solution for optimizing taxes and maximizing after-tax returns. This unique service sets Betterment apart in the fintech space and adds significant value for investors seeking to optimize their investment outcomes while minimizing their tax burden.**
